# Kolme Technical Overview

<!-- toc -->

## Purpose

Kolme is a Rust-powered blockchain framework that enables developers to build fast, secure, and flexible decentralized applications, each running on its own dedicated, public, and transparent blockchain. Designed to overcome the limitations of shared blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Near—such as congestion, gas fees, and restrictive smart contract environments—Kolme provides a robust platform for engineers to create scalable apps with seamless multichain integration. This page offers a high-level technical overview of Kolme’s architecture and core features, serving as an entry point for developers building on the platform. It introduces key concepts like dedicated chains, Rust-based logic, and efficient state management, preparing you for deeper dives into specific components.

## Dedicated Blockchains

Kolme’s defining feature is its dedicated blockchain architecture: each application operates on its own isolated, public blockchain, eliminating the block space competition that slows down shared platforms like Ethereum or Solana. This ensures instant transaction processing, free from congestion-based delays, making Kolme ideal for high-performance apps like trading platforms, cross-chain swaps, or betting systems. Each blockchain is transparent, with all transactions—user actions, fund transfers, or software upgrades—recorded on-chain and verifiable by any node, developer, or auditor. Dedicated chains enable developers to focus on app functionality without worrying about network contention, while validators benefit from simplified, efficient node operations. This scalability and independence make Kolme a powerful platform for building and deploying decentralized applications.

## Deterministic Rust Execution

Kolme liberates developers from the constraints of traditional smart contracts by allowing full application logic to be written in Rust, a high-performance, memory-safe programming language. Unlike Ethereum’s Solidity or Solana’s constrained environments, which impose gas fees, execution time limits, and split logic requirements, Kolme apps run entirely on-chain with no such restrictions. Rust’s deterministic execution ensures that transactions produce consistent, reproducible results across all nodes, critical for maintaining blockchain integrity. Developers can leverage the full Rust ecosystem—including libraries and server-side tools—to build complex features, such as real-time trading algorithms, payout calculations for betting apps, or automated market makers (AMMs) for cross-chain swaps. This flexibility accelerates development, enhances security, and supports rapid prototyping, addressing concerns about the complexity of blockchain programming.

## Efficient State Management

Kolme manages application and system state efficiently using a MerkleMap, a base-16 balanced tree optimized for large datasets (hundreds of MBs or GBs). This structure supports fast hashing, cloning, and updates, ensuring scalability without compromising performance.

- **Framework State**: Represents the cumulative system state from all transactions since the genesis block, including account balances, validator sets, nonces (for transaction ordering), admin proposals (e.g., upgrades), and the `chain_version` (the code version used by the chain). Stored in a MerkleMap, only state hashes are included in blocks to avoid exceeding storage and network limits, addressing concerns about state size and scalability.
- **App State**: Arbitrary data defined by the application, also stored in a MerkleMap, allowing developers to manage custom data structures (e.g., trade histories, betting outcomes) tailored to their app’s needs.

The MerkleMap’s design ensures efficient state updates and verification, enabling nodes to validate processor outputs quickly. Note that the framework state is not just a block number but a comprehensive snapshot of the system, crucial for developers building robust apps.

## Multichain Integration

Kolme seamlessly integrates with multiple blockchains, including Solana, Ethereum, and Near, allowing apps to support users across ecosystems. Bridge contracts on external chains handle fund deposits and withdrawals, validated by listeners and approvers, ensuring secure, transparent interactions. Kolme’s design makes it easy to add new chains (e.g., Aptos, Cosmos) without rewriting apps, addressing concerns about choosing the “wrong” chain initially. For example, a cross-chain swap app can start with Solana and Ethereum support and later add Near with minimal changes, all while maintaining on-chain security and transparency. This flexibility reduces technical debt and enhances scalability, making Kolme attractive for developers building multichain apps and investors seeking adaptable platforms.

## External Chain Resilience

Kolme’s architecture minimizes reliance on external blockchains, ensuring apps remain operational during disruptions. External chains are only needed for payment on-ramps and off-ramps (e.g., depositing or withdrawing funds), meaning downtime or congestion on Solana, Ethereum, or Near won’t interrupt core app operations like transaction processing or state updates. For instance, a trading app continues executing orders even if Ethereum faces delays. Additionally, Kolme simplifies future chain migrations compared to other systems. If you need to switch or add chains (e.g., from Solana to Cosmos), Kolme’s bridge contract system allows seamless transitions without extensive reengineering, preserving the security and transparency of on-chain logic. This resilience and adaptability make Kolme a reliable choice for developers and founders building high-availability apps.

## Key Features

Kolme’s technical foundation includes several features that empower developers:

- **No Gas Costs or Execution Limits**: Build apps without worrying about transaction fees or compute constraints, enabling complex, cost-free logic.
- **No Scheduled Block Times**: Process transactions on-demand, optimizing performance for your app’s needs.
- **Public, Verifiable Chains**: Ensure transparency with all actions recorded on-chain, verifiable by any stakeholder.
- **High Availability**: Run validators in robust clusters to guarantee uptime, with no risk of forks.
- **Secure Data Integration**: Fetch data from any source (Pyth, Chainlink, custom APIs) and store it on-chain for verification, bypassing oracle delays.
- **Web3 Wallet Support**: Integrate with Solana, Ethereum, and Near wallets, using ephemeral keys validated by wallets for secure, user-friendly interactions.

These features address common developer concerns, such as performance, cost, and complexity, making Kolme an accessible platform for building innovative decentralized applications.
