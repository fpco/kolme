# FP Block's Goals

Kolme is a framework produced by the [FP Block](https://www.fpblock.com) team. After years of building standard dapps on a variety of blockchains, we ended up running into the same issues time and again:

* Slow block times resulting in degraded user experience
* Awkward splits between smart contracts and backend services complicating development
* Unreliable blockchain nodes leading to system outages
* The difficulty of creating a secure environment when external data is needed by the system (oracle challenges)
* Multichain support

Our goal with Kolme is to provide a high quality, reusable, open source, and secure framework for building a new generation of dapps.

## Monetization

As an engineering consulting firm, FP Block's primary monetization strategy is to use Kolme as an application accelerator. We believe we can build more secure, high quality products in less time. In addition, if there's wider demand, we intend to offer managed hosting for Kolme applications, leveraging our network of partners to provide decentralized security for product companies.
