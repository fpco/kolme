## Triadic Trust Model

A system where three distinct groups—listeners, processor, and approvers—handle event detection, execution, and fund approval with customizable quorums, balancing speed and security in a single app chain. Kolme provides a novel mechanism for providing security and transparency without slowing down processing.

## Instant Block Production with External Data

The processor’s ability to generate blocks on-demand, pulling in external data (like price feeds) without oracle delays, and bundling it for verification.

## Component-Based Chain Architecture

A modular Rust framework where a core chain library pairs with plug-and-play components (listeners, API servers, etc.), all sharing state and notifications.

## High Availability Processor Cluster

Running the processor in an HA setup with leader election and hot standbys to keep block production uninterrupted.
