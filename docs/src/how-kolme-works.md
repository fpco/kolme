# How Kolme Works

<!-- toc -->

## Overview

Kolme is a transformative blockchain framework that enables developers to create fast, secure, and flexible applications, each powered by its own dedicated, public, and transparent blockchain. By overcoming the challenges of shared blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, and Near—such as congestion, gas fees, and complex multichain integrations—Kolme provides a streamlined platform for building decentralized apps that connect users across ecosystems. This page offers a high-level overview of Kolme’s architecture, security model, and user-friendly features, designed to appeal to validators ensuring network integrity, developers crafting innovative apps, investors seeking scalable solutions, and founders aiming to accelerate their vision.

## Dedicated Chains

Kolme’s core innovation is its dedicated blockchain architecture: every application runs on its own public, verifiable blockchain, free from the congestion that plagues shared platforms like Ethereum or Solana. This eliminates competition for block space, ensuring instant transaction processing and predictable performance, whether your app is a high-frequency trading platform, a cross-chain swap service, or a betting system. Dedicated chains also enhance transparency, as all actions—trades, swaps, or administrative updates—are recorded on-chain, accessible to users, validators, and auditors. For developers and founders, this means faster deployment and reliable scalability; for validators, it offers a low-overhead way to support robust apps; and for investors, it ensures a platform built for growth and trust.

## Triadic Security

Kolme’s security is anchored by a triadic model involving three validator groups—listeners, a processor, and approvers—working together to deliver trust, transparency, and resilience. This checks-and-balances system rivals the security of leading blockchains like Solana, Ethereum, and Near, while avoiding centralized vulnerabilities.

- **Listeners**: Monitor bridge contracts on external blockchains (Solana, Ethereum, Near) for events like fund deposits or wallet associations. When a majority agrees, they confirm these actions to the Kolme chain, ensuring seamless integration with external ecosystems.
- **Processor**: Executes transactions and produces blocks for the app’s blockchain, recording all actions transparently. It runs in a high-availability setup to ensure uninterrupted operation.
- **Approvers**: Authorize outgoing actions, such as fund withdrawals to external chains, by signing off on bridge contract operations, maintaining secure fund movements.

For administrative tasks, such as software upgrades or validator group changes, all three groups can participate, with a quorum of at least two required for approval. This flexible, secure system ensures rapid adaptation without compromising integrity, benefiting validators with efficient roles, developers with a trusted platform, and investors with a scalable, tamper-resistant framework.

## Rust Flexibility

Kolme frees developers from traditional blockchain constraints by enabling full application logic to be written in Rust, a high-performance programming language. Unlike smart contracts on Ethereum or Solana, which impose execution limits and require splitting logic between on-chain and off-chain systems, Kolme apps run entirely on-chain with no gas costs, execution time limits, or scheduled block times. Developers can leverage the full Rust ecosystem—including server-side tools and libraries—to build complex features, such as real-time trading algorithms, intricate betting logic, or multichain AMMs. This accelerates development, enhances app robustness, and shortens time-to-market, making Kolme a top choice for developers and founders innovating rapidly and investors seeking efficient, scalable solutions.

## External Integration

Kolme’s seamless integration with external data and blockchains empowers apps to deliver real-world functionality and broad accessibility.

- **Secure Data Loads**: Kolme apps fetch data from any source—public oracles like Pyth and Chainlink, proprietary APIs for sports odds, or custom feeds—via secure HTTP requests. Data is stored on-chain with cryptographic signatures, enabling other nodes to verify accuracy without slow, centralized oracles. For instance, a trading app accesses live price feeds instantly, while a betting app uses real-time sports data, all transparently and securely.
- **Multichain Support**: Kolme’s bridge contracts manage funds on multiple blockchains, including Solana, Ethereum, and Near, allowing users to deposit and withdraw from their preferred ecosystem. Developers can easily add new chains (e.g., Aptos, Cosmos) without rewriting apps, ensuring future-proof accessibility. This multichain flexibility simplifies cross-chain app development, benefiting developers building inclusive apps and investors eyeing adaptable platforms.

## External Chain Resilience

Kolme ensures your app remains operational even when external blockchains face disruptions, offering unmatched reliability and flexibility. Kolme only depends on external chains like Solana, Ethereum, or Near for payment on-ramps and off-ramps—depositing funds into your app or withdrawing them to a user’s wallet. Downtime, node outages, or congestion on these chains won’t interrupt your app’s core operations, such as processing trades, bets, or swaps. For example, a trading app on Kolme continues executing orders even if Ethereum faces delays, ensuring a seamless user experience.

Additionally, Kolme makes migrating to new chains in the future far easier than other systems. If you initially build for one chain (e.g., Solana) but later want to support another (e.g., Cosmos), Kolme’s design allows you to add new chains without extensive reengineering, all while preserving the security and transparency of on-chain logic. This future-proof approach reduces technical debt and enhances scalability, making Kolme a strategic choice for developers and founders planning long-term growth and investors prioritizing adaptable, secure platforms.

## User Experience

Kolme delivers a seamless, secure user experience, making it easy for anyone to engage with your app, regardless of blockchain expertise.

- **Web3 Wallet Integration**: Users connect Solana, Ethereum, or Near wallets to Kolme apps, depositing funds via bridge contracts to link wallets to Kolme accounts, leveraging familiar tools for easy onboarding.
- **Ephemeral Keys**: Transactions, such as placing bets or executing trades, are signed with ephemeral private keys generated in the browser frontend and validated with the user’s Web3 wallet. This ensures secure, self-custodied interactions without exposing long-term keys.
- **Failed Transaction Notifications**: Failed transactions trigger instant user notifications, enhancing clarity and trust. Planned watchdog nodes will monitor these for fairness, further boosting transparency.
- **Multichain Accessibility**: Users can join from any supported chain, and Kolme’s extensible design allows developers to add new chains as needed, ensuring your app reaches a growing audience.

This user-centric design lowers adoption barriers, appealing to diverse users and supporting the growth objectives of developers, founders, and investors.
